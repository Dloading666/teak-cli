//! Crush — third-class (T3) integration: brand icon + one-click launch only.
//!
//! No session-history scanning and no hook surface (so no Dynamic Island /
//! live status dot — that stays Claude-only). Registered in `TOOLS` purely so
//! the launchpad gets its display name (`list_tools`), its PATH "installed"
//! probe, and the launch binary. `binary_name` is the command users run.
