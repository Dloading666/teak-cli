//! OpenClaw — `openclaw` binary.

//! Skills live under the workspace root at

//! `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`; users overriding that won't get
//! the junction at the right place. See `agent_mcp_config.rs`
//! for the read-openclaw.json pattern when we lift this dynamic.

    // only ChatReader bubble view was removed), and the Rust resume path
    // (terminal.rs AGENT_PRESETS) has `resume_program: None` for openclaw,
    // so server.rs returns "Tool 'openclaw' does not support resume" and

    // + `sessions.json` index + `state/openclaw.sqlite`), but since Coffee
    // CLI can't resume any of them, collecting them only manufactures
    // broken rows. Drop the shape → scanner skips openclaw entirely.
    // If OpenClaw ever ships a CLI resume entry point, restore the
    // GenericJsonl shape (root ".openclaw/agents", depth 3) and add a
    // resume_program arm in terminal.rs.
